# Almor Proposal Builder — public deployment

This is the public Streamlit deployment wrapper for the private Almor Proposal
Builder source repository.

Customer proposal examples, handwritten signatures, Standard Terms, the Work
Authorization form, and the derived knowledge index are not committed in
plaintext. They are stored in `proposal_private_assets.enc` and require the
private `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` configured in Streamlit Secrets.

The public website also requires `APP_ACCESS_CODE`, so only authorized users can
submit client material, consume the configured OpenAI API account, or generate
documents containing signatures.

The default AI routing uses `gpt-5.6-luna` for request and attachment extraction,
and `gpt-5.6-terra` for professional proposal drafting.

The **Add Final Proposal to Library** workflow writes reviewed Final Word files,
their search records, and private draft/final revision records directly to the
private source repository. Reusable edits must occur in at least three reviewed
proposals and still require explicit approval before becoming drafting rules.
This workflow requires these additional Streamlit Secrets:

```toml
GITHUB_LIBRARY_TOKEN = "a-fine-grained-token-restricted-to-Steven352/proposal"
GITHUB_LIBRARY_REPO = "Steven352/proposal"
GITHUB_LIBRARY_BRANCH = "main"
```

The fine-grained token must have **Contents: Read and write** permission only on
the private proposal repository. It must never be committed to this public
deployment repository.

The canonical private source repository is not linked here intentionally.
